# Angular Customizable Dashboard

This is a customizable Angular Dashboard - built with Angular 18.1 and Angular Material 18 using Material Design 3.

Version: 1.2.3

Features of the dashboard:

- TailwindCSS integrated for utility-CSS styling!
- Dynamically add and remove widgets to the dashboard with drag and drop panel
- Reposition widgets by drag and drop
- Resize the widget height and width using the options panel
- Changes in layout are animated nicely using animate-css-grid package
- Dashboard layouts once setup are automatically synced with local storage
- Includes sample widgets for showing statistics, graphs using chart.js and other relevant widgets such as a comments list.
- This app also includes the nested sidebar I've built previously in another series of YouTube tutorials and all of the routes are lazily loaded - for best performance!
